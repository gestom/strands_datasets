        <h1>STRANDS public datasets</h1>
	Here are datasets that we used for long-term autonomy.
	<hr/>
	<h2>Witham Wharf RGB-D dataset</h2>
	
	The Witham Wharf was collected for purposes of testing RGB-D localization in changing environments.
	The dataset consists of one training set and three testing sets that cover changes of eight locations in an open-plan office for one year.

	<h3>Why and how was the dataset gathered</h3>
	<p>The intended use was to create a dataset to benchmark visual localization in changing environments.
	See and hear the 2 minute video below. If you are interrested only in how the dataset was collected, simply skip the first minute of the video or click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=aTr9KD4XMGc#t=74">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Organisation</h3>
	<p>Color images of the dataset are arranged into eight folders according to the location they were captured at.
	Images were captured on a regular basis every 10 minutes and their filename corresponds to the time they were captured at.
	For example <i>00000.bmp</i> was captured at midnight the first day, <i>00012.bmp</i> at 2:10 am and <i>00145.bmp</i> at 0:10am of the second day of the data collection.
	Please note that sometimes the robot got stuck and failed to capture an image at a given location.
	For our method, we needed to substitute these missing images by taking the last previously captured image.</p>

	<h3>Dataset use</h3>
	If you use the dataset for your research, it is mandatory to cite our <a href="WW_RGB/paper.pdf">paper</a> that describes it.
	We attached a <a href="WW_RGB/paper.bib">bibtex</a> record for your convenience.

	<h2>Lincoln lecturer long and deep (dataset)</h2>

	This dataset contains depth images captured by a stationary Asus Xtion sensor located in a small lecturer office in the University of Lincoln.
	The sensor captures a depth image every 5 seconds since April 2013 and files are uploaded automagically every day. 
	The data is recorded simply as a sequence of 320x240x16b images, so you need to download a few <a href="GREG/files/utilities.zip">utilities</a> to convert them to ROS-compatible or Asus-native formats.
