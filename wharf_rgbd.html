	<h2>Witham Wharf RGB-D dataset</h2>
	
	<p align="justify">The Witham Wharf was collected for purposes of testing RGB-D localization in changing environments.
	The dataset consists of one training set and three testing sets that cover changes of eight locations in an open-plan office for one year.
	We provide the gathered data in form of rosbags and color images.</p>

	<h3>Dataset purpose</h3>
	<p align="justify">The intended use was to create a dataset to benchmark visual and RGB-D localization in changing environments.
	See and hear the 2 minute video below. If you are interrested only in how the dataset was collected, simply skip the first minute of the video or click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=aTr9KD4XMGc#t=74" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Dataset structure</h3>
	<h4>Rosbags</h4>
	<p align="justify">The provided archives contain rosbags, which are zipped into separate files according to the day of the data collection.  
	Each rosbag contains a depth/color image, camera information, robot position, tf data and laser scan captured by the robot at a location and time that is encoded in the rosbag name, which contains day, month, year, hour, minute and location id.
	For example, <i>3D_16-11-13-15-20_place_3.bag</i> contains data gathered at location 3 on Nov 16 2013 at 15:20 o'clock.</p>

	<h4>Color images</h4>
	<p align="justify">Color images of the dataset are arranged into eight folders according to the location they were captured at.
	Images were captured on a regular basis every 10 minutes and their filename corresponds to the time they were captured at.
	For example <i>00000.bmp</i> was captured at midnight the first day, <i>00012.bmp</i> at 2:10 am on the first day and <i>00145.bmp</i> at 0:10am of the second day of the data collection.
	Please note that sometimes the robot got stuck and failed to capture an image at a given location.
	For our method, we needed to substitute these missing images by taking the last previously captured image.</p>
